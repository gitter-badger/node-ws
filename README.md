Repository for the Spider Javascript+Node.js workshop's code

## Javascript

These contain basic Javascript coding examples to demonstrate the features of the language.
They can be executed by typing in the following command:

```
	node [filename.js]
```

Besides the workshop, there are a lot of other resources to check out such as [Douglas Crockford's blog](http://javascript.crockford.com/), [this JS books resource](http://jsbooks.revolunet.com/) and the [MSDN Javascript Reference](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/vstudio/jj673959.aspx)

## Node.js

This repo will consist of the various stages in creating a Node.js website from scratch and an introduction to Express, Passport and other Node modules. Furthermore, we will also cover the various other uses of Node.js other than for just website creation.
